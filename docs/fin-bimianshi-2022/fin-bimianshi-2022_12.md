**Summary of the current situation**

**Shake n’ Stir**

一家酒吧设备制造商，提供三种服务：Bar equipment，Mini-bars，Installation service。

创始人理念为提供高质量产品和专家建议，推测走高端路线，对客户讨价还价能力强。

比起购买零件更倾向于自己生产，对供应商讨价还价能力强。

由财报可知，Bar Equipment 和 Installation Service Contracts 收入减少，成本增加，Mini-bar / Mini-fridge 与之相反。

想进入全国市场但进展有限，这也不是优先事项。

正致力于进一步增加 mini-bars/ mini-fridges 的销售额。

**市场**

客户：遍布全国但大多数客户是 independent pubs, bars, hotels or small hospitality chains in the local region。总体客户数量减少，Mini-bars 和 Martin's Bars 客户数量增加。

Her vision was to support customers in fitting out their bars byproviding high quality products and expert advice to meet their needs.

In 2012, Shaken’ Stir decided to reduce its reliance on foreign imports of two particularly importantcomponents, condensers and evaporators since these were proving expensive andunreliable.
