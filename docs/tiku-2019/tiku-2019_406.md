Opponents should remember that the New Deal pulled this country out of great economic troubles even though some of its programs were later found to be unconstitutional. The opponents could effectively defend their position against the author’s strategy by pointing out that

正确答案: E   你的答案: 空 (错误)

```cpp
the expertise of those opposing the law is outstanding
```

```cpp
the lack of justification for the new law does not imply that those who
drew it up were either inept or immoral
```

```cpp
the practical application of the new law will not entail indiscriminate
budget cuts
```

```cpp
economic troubles present at the time of the New Deal were equal in
severity to those that have led to the present law
```

```cpp
the fact that certain flawed programs or laws have improved the economy
does not prove that every such program can do so

具体看这堆硬币有多少： 如果是 4n+1 枚，（n 为非负整数）先手必输。因为不管先手每轮怎么拿（拿 x 个），后手每轮补到 4 个（即拿 4-x 个），最后后手能拿到 4n，先手必拿第 4n+1，也就是最后一枚。 如果是 4n+x 枚，（n 为非负整数，x=｛0，2，3｝）先手必胜。我们把 x=0 看作 x=4，n=n-1。此时先手第一轮只要拿 x-1 枚，就能将问题转化为：先手变后手，后手变先手，取 4n+1 枚硬币的问题。这个问题之前讨论过，此时是转变后的后手必胜，也就是转变前的先手必胜。 如果硬币总数 N%4==1，后手必胜，其他情况先手必胜，所以总胜率 25%。

Crowding on Mooreville's subway frequently leads to delays, because it is difficult for passengers to exit from the trains. Subway ridership is projected to increase by 20 percent over the next 10 years. The Mooreville Transit Authority plans to increase the number of daily train trips by only 5 percent over the same period. Officials predict that this increase is sufficient to ensure that the incidence of delays due to crowding does not increase.Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest grounds for the officials' prediction?

正确答案: D   你的答案: 空 (错误)

```cpp
By changing maintenance schedules, the Transit Authority can achieve the
5 percent increase in train trips without purchasing any new subway cars.
```

```cpp
The Transit Authority also plans a 5 percent increase in the number of
bus trips on routes that connect to subways.
```

```cpp
For most commuters who use the subway system, there is no practical
alternative public transportation available.
```

```cpp
Most of the projected increase in ridership is expected to occur in
off-peak hours when trains are now sparsely used.
```

```cpp
The 5 percent increase in the number of train trips can be achieved
without an equal increase in Transit Authority operational costs.
