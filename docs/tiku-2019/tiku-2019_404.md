P company has a huge data center with n servers. There are n - 1 lines between these servers. If two servers are connected by a wire, data can only be sent from one server to another, but not vise versa. Without considering the direction of data transmission, one server can reach any other servers, which means that all servers are connected. The engineer wants to select a central server which needs to send data to all other servers. To achieve this goal, the direction of some wires should be changed. The engineer is very lazy and he wants to select the server which can result in the least operations on wires.

The boss of P company plays an interesting game with employees. At the beginning, the boss gives a very long string with length m. The boss invites n employees to reorder the string with command a, s, e, where a in {0, 1} denotes the type of operation, s and e are positions in the string. If a = 0, all characters from s to e are ordered in non-increasing order. If a = 1, all characters from s to e are ordered in non-decreasing order. After n times operation, the boss wants to know the final string.

Given two zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N (N >= 0) integers, which represent N fishes in a river, ordered from west to east.
The fish are numbered from 0 to N-1, and Fish number X is represented by A[X] and B[X]. Array A contains the sizes of the fishes, while array B contains the directions they swim, which can be 1 (from west to east) or -1 (from east to west).

If two fishes move in opposite directions meet each other, the larger fish will eat the smaller one, and the survival will still follow its original direction.

We assume that all fishes are in different sizes and swimming at the same speed. The goal is to calculate the number of fishes that will stay alive.

For example:

A is [3, 5, 9, 1, 2]
B is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1]

Fish number 1 will eat Fish number 0, Fish number 4 will eat Fish number 3 and be eaten by Fish number 2\. Therefore the output should be 2 (Fish number 1 and Fish number 2 are still alive)

Give a undirected graph, each edge’s length is 1, each node has a numeric ID. There are some special nodes in the graph, node’s the minimum distance to the special node is the length of shortest path to the nearest special node. Please calculate all the nodes’ minimum distance to special node. If a node could not reach any special node the distance is –1.
